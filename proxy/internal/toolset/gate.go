// The guardrail on submit: the edit loop, enforced.
//
// A media person is asking for a change, not reviewing one. The loop the skill
// teaches — edit, build, look, submit — is what keeps a change that does not
// build or a template nobody looked at out of a maintainer's pull request list,
// and a loop that is only taught is a loop a busy session skips.
//
// The facts come from the change's own stamps on the state volume. The decision
// is here rather than in workdir because a refusal has to name the tool to run,
// and tool names belong to this layer.

// ErrNotReady is a submit the loop has not finished. It is one error carrying
// every missing step, so a model learns all of them in one turn instead of
// discovering them one refusal at a time.
